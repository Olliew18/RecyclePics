# 🎉 WasteSmart Prototype is Ready!

## ✅ Services Running

### ML Service (Port 8001) ✅
- **YOLOv8 model loaded and ready**
- Health endpoint: `http://localhost:8001/health`
- Recognition endpoint: `http://localhost:8001/recognize`
- Confidence threshold: 70%

### Backend API (Port 3000) ✅  
- **Express.js server running**
- Health endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- Council lookup: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/councils/{postcode}`

## 📍 Test Locations Configured

### Westminster (SW1A 1AA)
- **Stricter rules**: Disposable cups go to general waste
- Collection days: Compost (Wed), Recycling (Mon), General (Tue)

### Tower Hamlets (E1 6AN)  
- **More lenient**: Disposable cups can be recycled
- Collection days: Compost (Thu), Recycling (Fri), General (Mon)

## 🧪 What You Can Test Now

1. **ML Recognition**: Upload images to see YOLOv8 detect objects
2. **Location Rules**: Different postcodes give different disposal guidance
3. **Council Lookup**: Get waste collection info for each area

## 📱 Next Steps

1. **Test with real photos**: Point camera at actual food waste
2. **Mobile app**: Start the React Native app to see the full interface
3. **Custom training**: Use your dataset to improve recognition accuracy

## 🚀 How to Start Mobile App

```bash
cd mobile
npm run web
# Open browser to http://localhost:8081
```

## 🎯 Basic Prototype Complete!

You now have a working food waste recognition system that:
- ✅ Recognizes objects in photos (YOLOv8)
- ✅ Maps objects to disposal guidance  
- ✅ Provides location-specific rules
- ✅ Ready for real-world testing

**The core functionality is working!** 🎉
